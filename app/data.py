        'abstract': """
        Objective:
        We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
        in improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemia compared to self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG).
        Methods:
        We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Scopus for randomized trials of adults
        and children with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM or T2DM). Pairs of reviewers independently
        selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. Meta-analytic estimates of treatment effects
        were generated using a random-effects model.
        Results:
        Nineteen trials were eligible and provided data for meta-analysis. Overall, CGM was associated with a significant
        reduction in mean hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c; weighted mean difference (WMD) of -0.27% (95% confidence
        interval [CI] -0.44 to -0.10)]. This was true for adults with T1DM as well as T2DM [WMD -0.50% (95% CI
        -0.69 to -0.30) and -0.70 (95% CI, -1.14 to -0.27), respectively]. No significant effect was noted in children and
        adolescents. There was no significant difference in HbA1c reduction between studies of real-time versus non-real-
        time devices (WMD -0.22%, 95% CI, -0.59 to 0.15 versus -0.30%, 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.10; p for interaction 0.71).
        The quality of evidence was moderate due to imprecision, suggesting increased risk for bias. Data for the
        incidence of severe or nocturnal hypoglycemia were sparse and imprecise. In studies that reported patient
        satisfaction, users felt confident about the device and gave positive reviews. Conclusion:
        Continuous glucose monitoring seems to help improve glycemic control in adults with T1DM and T2DM.
        The effect on hypoglycemia incidence is imprecise and unclear. Larger trials with longer follow-up are needed
        to assess the efficacy of CGM in reducing patient-important complications without significantly increasing
        the burden of care for patients with diabetes.

Aims/hypothesis The aim of this work was to assess the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) vs self- monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in maintaining glycaemic control among people with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Methods Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, trial registries and grey literature were searched from 9 June 2011 until 22 December 2020 for RCTs comparing CGM intervention against SMBG control among the non-pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus of all ages and both sexes on multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with HbA1c levels, severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as outcomes. Studies also included any individual or caregiver-led CGM systems. Studies involving GlucoWatch were excluded. Risk of bias was appraised with Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta- analysis and meta-regression were performed using Review Manager software and R software, respectively. Heterogeneity was evaluated using χ2 and I2 statistics. Overall effects and certainty of evidence were evaluated using Z statistic and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) software.
Results Twenty-two studies, involving 2188 individuals with type 1 diabetes, were identified. Most studies had low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of 21 studies involving 2149 individuals revealed that CGM significantly decreased HbA1c levels compared with SMBG (mean difference −2.46 mmol/mol [−0.23%] [95% CI −3.83, −1.08], Z = 3.50, p=0.0005), with larger effects experi- enced among higher baseline HbA1c >64 mmol/mol (>8%) individuals (mean difference −4.67 mmol/mol [−0.43%] [95% CI −6.04, −3.30], Z = 6.69, p<0.00001). However, CGM had no influence on the number of severe hypoglycaemia (p=0.13) and DKA events (p=0.88). Certainty of evidence was moderate.
Conclusions/interpretation CGM is superior to SMBG in improving glycaemic control among individuals with type 1 diabetes in the community, especially in those with uncontrolled glycaemia. Individuals with type 1 diabetes with HbA1c >64 mmol/mol (>8%) are most likely to benefit from CGM. Current findings could not confer a concrete conclusion on the effectiveness of CGM on DKA outcome as DKA incidences were rare. Current evidence is also limited to outpatient settings. Future research should evaluate the accuracy of CGM and the effectiveness of CGM across different age groups and insulin regimens as these remain unclear in this paper.

        'abstract': """
Background: Existing technologies for type 1 diabetes have not been compared against the full range of alternative devices. Multiple metrics of glycemia and patient-reported outcomes for evaluating technologies also require consideration. We thus conducted a systematic review, network meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis to compare the relative efficacy of available technologies for the management of type 1 diabetes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and other nonindexed citations, EMBASE, PubMed, All Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and PROSPERO (inception— April 24, 2019). We included RCT ‡6 weeks duration comparing technologies for type 1 diabetes management among nonpregnant adults (>18 years of age). Data were extracted using a predefined tool. Primary outcomes were A1c (%), hypoglycemia rates, and quality of life (QoL). We estimated mean difference for A1c and nonsevere hypoglycemia, rate ratio for severe hypoglycemia, and standardized mean difference for QoL in network meta-analysis with random effects.
Results: We identified 16,772 publications, of which 52 eligible studies compared 12 diabetes management technologies comprising 3,975 participants in network meta-analysis. Integrated insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems with low-glucose suspend or hybrid closed-loop algorithms resulted in A1c levels 0.96% (predictive interval [95% PrI] 0.04–1.89) and 0.87% (95% PrI 0.12–1.63) lower than multiple daily injections with either flash glucose monitoring or capillary glucose testing, respectively. In addition, integrated systems had the best ranking for A1c reduction utilizing the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA–96.4). While treatment effects were nonsignificant for many technology comparisons regarding severe hypoglycemia and QoL, simultaneous evaluation of outcomes in cluster analyses as well as narrative synthesis appeared to favor integrated insulin pump and continuous glucose monitors. Overall risk of bias was moderate–high. Certainty of evidence was very low.
Conclusions: Integrated insulin pump and CGM systems with low-glucose suspend or hybrid closed-loop capability appeared best for A1c reduction, composite ranking for A1c and severe hypoglycemia, and possibly QoL.

        Background
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is essential to optimise glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems measure interstitial fluid glucose levels to provide semi-continuous information about glucose levels, which identifies fluctuations that would not have been identified with conventional self-monitoring. Two types of CGM systems can be defined: retrospective systems and real-time systems. Real-time systems continuously provide the actual glucose concentration on a display. Currently, the use of CGM is not common practice and its reimbursement status is a point of debate in many countries.
Objectives
To assess the effects of CGM systems compared to conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1.
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for the identification of studies. Last search date was June 8, 2011. Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing retrospective or real-time CGM with conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose levels or with another type of CGM system in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Primary outcomes were glycaemic control, e.g. level of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were adverse events and complications, CGM derived glycaemic control, death and costs.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias and performed data-extraction. Although there was clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies an exploratory meta-analysis was performed on those outcomes the authors felt could be pooled without losing clinical merit.
Main results
The search identified 1366 references. Twenty-two RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria of this review were identified. The results of the meta- analyses (across all age groups) indicate benefit of CGM for patients starting on CGM sensor augmented insulin pump therapy compared to patients using multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) and standard monitoring blood glucose (SMBG). After six months there was a significant larger decline in HbA1c level for real-time CGM users starting insulin pump therapy compared to patients using MDI and SMBG
(mean difference (MD) in change in HbA1c level -0.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.8% to -0.5%, 2 RCTs, 562 patients, I2=84%). The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased for CGM users, but CIs were wide and included unity (4/43 versus 1/35; RR 3.26, 95% CI 0.38 to 27.82 and 21/247 versus 17/248; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.29). One study reported the occurrence of ketoacidosis from baseline to six months; there was however only one event. Both RCTs were in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.
For patients starting with CGM only, the average decline in HbA1c level six months after baseline was also statistically significantly larger for CGM users compared to SMBG users, but much smaller than for patients starting using an insulin pump and CGM at the same time (MD change in HbA1c level -0.2%, 95% CI -0.4% to -0.1%, 6 RCTs, 963 patients, I2=55%). On average, there was no significant difference in risk of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis between CGM and SMBG users. The confidence interval however, was wide and included a decreased as well as an increased risk for CGM users compared to the control group (severe hypoglycaemia: 36/411 versus 33/407; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.62, 4 RCTs, I2=0% and ketoacidosis: 8/411 versus 8/407; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.40, 4 RCTs, I2=0%).
Health-related quality of life was reported in five of the 22 studies. In none of these studies a significant difference between CGM and SMBG was found. Diabetes complications, death and costs were not measured.
There were no studies in pregnant women with diabetes type 1 and in patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness.
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use in children, adults and patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The largest improvements in glycaemic control were seen for sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in patients with poorly controlled diabetes who had not used an insulin pump before. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis was not significantly increased for CGM users, but as these events occurred infrequent these results have to be interpreted cautiously.There are indications that higher compliance of wearing the CGM device improves glycosylated haemoglobin A1c level (HbA1c) to a larger extent.

        'abstract': """
Background Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RTCGM) may help in the management of individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); however, the evidence supporting its use is unclear. The available meta-analyses on this topic use aggregate data which weaken inference.
Objective Individual patient data were obtained from random- ized controlled trials (RCTs) to conduct a meta-analysis and synthesize evidence about the effect of RTCGM on glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), hypoglycaemic events and time spent in hypoglycaemia in T1DM.
Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through January 2015. We included RCTs that enrolled individuals with T1DM and compared RTCGM vs control group. A two-step regression model was used to pool individual patient data.
Results We included 11 RCTs at moderate risk of bias. Meta- analysis suggests that the use of RTCGM is associated with a sta- tistically significant but modest reduction in HbA1c . The improvements in HbA1c were primarily seen in individuals over age 15 years. We were unable to identify a statistically significant difference in time spent in hypoglycaemia or the number of hypoglycaemic episodes although these analyses were imprecise and warrant lower confidence. There was no difference between males and females.
Conclusion RTCGM in T1DM is associated with a reduction in HbA1c primarily in individuals over 15 years of age. We were unable to identify a statistically significant difference in the time spent in hypoglycaemia or the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes.

Introduction: Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, pose a significant concern in critically ill
patients due to prolonged immobility and complex medical conditions.
Objective: This review examines the evidence supporting various nursing interventions to prevent
pressure ulcers in critically ill patients.
Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies published
between 2010 and 2023. Key interventions included regular repositioning, specialized mattresses
and cushions, skin care protocols, nutritional support, and patient and staff education.
Results: The evidence supports a multifaceted approach, including regular repositioning,
specialized support surfaces, comprehensive skin care, nutritional support, and education, in
reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers in critically ill patients.
Conclusion: Implementing evidence-based nursing interventions can significantly reduce the
incidence of pressure ulcers in critically ill patients, emphasizing the importance of a coordinated
approach to prevention.

        'abstract': """
Background: Pressure ulcers are associated with substantial health burden, but could be pre-
ventable. Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) prevention has become a priority for all

healthcare settings, as it is considered a sign of quality of care providing. Intensive care unit
(ICU) patients are at higher risk for HAPUs development. Despite the availability of published
prevention strategies, there is a little evidence about which strategies can be safely integrated
into routine standard care and have an impact on HAPUs prevention.
Aims: The aim was to synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of single
strategies designed to reduce the incidence and prevalence of HAPUs development in ICUs.
Methods: The search strategy was designed to retrieve studies published in English across
CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Scopus, and Mednar
between 2000 and 2015. All adult ICU participants were aged 18 years or over. This review
included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental and comparative studies. The studies
that were selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological
validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical-appraisal instruments.
Results: The review included 25 studies, and the meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant
effect of a silicon foam dressing strategy in reducing HAPUs incidence (effect size = 4.62; 95%
CI: 0.05-0.29; p < .00001, effect size = 4.50; 95% CI: 0.05-0.31; p = .00001, respectively) in
critically ill patients. Evidence of the effectiveness of nutrition, skin-care regimen, positioning
and repositioning schedule, support surfaces, and the role of education in prevention of HAPUs
development in the ICU was limited, which precludes strong conclusions.
Linking Evidence to Action: The review provides an evidence-based guide to future priorities
for clinical practice. In particular, a silicone foam dressing has positive impact in reducing sacrum
and heel HAPUs incidence in the ICU.

Background
Pressure ulcers (also known as bedsores, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue

due to pressure, shear or friction. They are common in the elderly and immobile and costly in financial and human terms. Pressure-
relieving beds, mattresses and seat cushions are widely used as aids to prevention in both institutional and non-institutional settings.

Objectives
This systematic review seeks to answer the following questions:
(1) to what extent do pressure-relieving cushions, beds, mattress overlays and mattress replacements reduce the incidence of pressure
ulcers compared with standard support surfaces?
(2) how effective are different pressure-relieving surfaces in preventing pressure ulcers, compared to one another?
Search strategy
For this second update the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register was searched (28/2/08), The Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)(2008 Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to February Week 3 2008), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2008
Week 08) and Ovid CINAHL (1982 to February Week 3 2008). The reference sections of included studies were searched for further
trials.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published or unpublished, which assessed the effectiveness of beds, mattresses, mattress overlays,
and seating cushions for the prevention of pressure ulcers, in any patient group, in any setting. Study selection was undertaken by at
least two authors independently with a third author resolving uncertainty. RCTs were eligible for inclusion if they reported an objective,
clinical outcome measure such as incidence and severity of new of pressure ulcers developed. Studies which only reported proxy outcome
measures such as interface pressure were excluded.
Data collection and analysis
Trial data were extracted by one researcher and checked by a second. The results from each study are presented as relative risk for
dichotomous variables. Where deemed appropriate, similar studies were pooled in a meta analysis.

Main results
For this second update 11 trials met the inclusion criteria bringing the total number of RCTs included in the review to 52.
Foam alternatives to the standard hospital foam mattress can reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in people at risk. The relative merits
of alternating and constant low pressure devices are unclear. There is one high quality trial comparing the different alternating pressure
devices for pressure ulcer prevention which suggests that alternating pressure mattresses may be more cost effective than alternating
pressure overlays.
Pressure-relieving overlays on the operating table have been shown to reduce postoperative pressure ulcer incidence, although two
studies indicated that foam overlays resulted in adverse skin changes. Two trials indicated that Australian standard medical sheepskins
prevented pressure ulcers. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the value of seat cushions, limb protectors and various
constant low pressure devices as pressure ulcer prevention strategies.
A study of Accident & Emergency trolley overlays did not identify a reduction in pressure ulcer incidence. There are tentative indications
that foot waffle heel elevators, a particular low air loss hydrotherapy mattress and two types of operating theatre overlays are harmful.
Authors’ conclusions
In people at high risk of pressure ulcer development higher specification foam mattresses rather than standard hospital foam mattresses
should be used. The relative merits of higher-tech constant low pressure and alternating pressure for prevention are unclear but
alternating pressure mattresses may be more cost effective than alternating pressure overlays. Medical grade sheepskins are associated
with a decrease in pressure ulcer development. Organisations might consider the use of some forms of pressure relief for high risk
patients in the operating theatre. Seat cushions and overlays designed for use in Accident & Emergency settings have not been adequately
evaluated.

The aims of this study were to identify, assess, and summarise available evidence
about the effectiveness of static air mattress overlays to prevent pressure ulcers.
The primary outcome was the incidence of pressure ulcers. Secondary outcomes

included costs and patient comfort. This study was a systematic review. Six elec-
tronic databases were consulted: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed

(Medline), CINAHL (EBSCOhost interface), Science direct, and Web of Science.

In addition, a hand search through reviews, conference proceedings, and the refer-
ence lists of the included studies was performed to identify additional studies.

Potential studies were reviewed and assessed by 2 independent authors based on
the title and abstract. Decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion of the studies

were based on a consensus between the authors. Studies were included if the fol-
lowing criteria were met: reporting an original study; the outcome was the inci-
dence of pressure ulcer categories I to IV when using a static air mattress overlay

and/or in comparison with other pressure-redistribution device(s); and studies pub-
lished in English, French, and Dutch. No limitation was set on study setting,

design, and date of publication. The methodological quality assessment was evalu-
ated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Tool. Results were reported in a

descriptive way to reflect the exploratory nature of the review. The searches
included 13 studies: randomised controlled trials (n = 11) and cohort studies
(n = 2). The mean pressure ulcer incidence figures found in the different settings
were, respectively, 7.8% pressure ulcers of categories II to IV in nursing homes,
9.06% pressure ulcers of categories I to IV in intensive care settings, and 12%
pressure ulcers of categories I to IV in orthopaedic wards. Seven comparative
studies reported a lower incidence in the groups of patients on a static air mattress
overlay. Three studies reported a statistical (P < .1) lower incidence compared
with a standard hospital mattress (10 cm thick, density 35 kg/m3

), a foam mattress

(15 cm thick), and a viscoelastic foam mattress (15 cm thick). No significant dif-
ference in incidence, purchase costs, and patient comfort was found compared

with dynamic air mattresses. This review focused on the effectiveness of static air

mattress overlays to prevent pressure ulcers. There are indications that these mat-
tress overlays are more effective in preventing pressure ulcers compared with the

use of a standard mattress or a pressure-reducing foam mattress in nursing homes

and intensive care settings. However, interpretation of the evidence should be per-
formed with caution due to the wide variety of methodological and/or reporting

quality levels of the included studies.

Objectives: To undertake a systematic review of the effectiveness of pressure redistributing
support surfaces in the prevention of pressure ulcers.
Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources: Cochrane Wound Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. The reference
sections of included trials were searched for further trials.
Review methods: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials, published or
unpublished, which assessed the effects of support surfaces in preventing pressure ulcers
(of any grade), in any patient group, in any setting compared to any other support surface,
were sought. Two reviewers extracted and summarised details of eligible trials using a
standardised form and assessed the methodological quality of each trial using the
Cochrane risk of bias tool.
Results: Fifty-three eligible trials were identified with a total of 16,285 study participants.
Overall the risk of bias in the included trials was high. Pooled analysis showed that: (i)
foam alternatives to the standard hospital foam mattress reduce the incidence of pressure
ulcers in people at risk (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21–0.74) and Australian standard medical
sheepskins prevent pressure ulcers compared to standard care (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31–0.74).
Pressure-redistributing overlays on the operating table compared to standard care reduce
postoperative pressure ulcer incidence (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33–0.85).
Conclusions: While there is good evidence that higher specification foam mattresses,
sheepskins, and that some overlays in the operative setting are effective in preventing
pressure ulcers, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the value of seat
cushions, limb protectors and various constant low pressure devices. The relative merits of
higher-tech constant low pressure and alternating pressure for prevention are unclear.
More robust trials are required to address these research gaps.
